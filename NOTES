    - Shafts:
        The shafts (arbors) do not rotate.  All the gears rotate around the
        immobile shafts.
    - Hour hand:
        It is difficult to describe how I got the hour and minute hands on the
        same shaft without a picture.  But, look at the video around the 15
        second mark.  See the large gear behind the hour hand?  The hour hand
        is actually super glued to that gear (the hour gear).  It was the only
        application of glue in the clock.  The hour hand is really 3 separate
        pieces.  The pointer, the tail and a center black circle.  The pointer
        and tail rotate around the center black circle as opposed to being
        attached to it.  The hour gear also rotates around a circle and that
        circle rotate around the shaft.  So, the hour gear and hour hand
        effectively float around a cylindrical shaft made of layers of cut
        acrylic that drive the minute hand.  I hope that description makes some
        sense to you.
    - Escapement:
        Your escapement mechanism will not work.  Laser cutters are really bad
        at making long tapered teeth like that.  The tips will melt off.  Your
        pendulum swing angle is enormous; it will require too much power to
        sustain.  You might want to consider using a recoil escapement instead
        of a deadbeat escapement to avoid lubrication and precision issues.  If
        you have the resources, build and test your escapement mechanism first.
    - Ball bearings:
        More importantly, I discovered that making the gears to revolve around
        stationary shafts was a major design flaw.  It introduces way too much
        friction.  I wanted to make a clock could simply be screwed together
        (with the exception of the glued hour hand).  I should have screwed the
        gears to ball bearing pivots.
    - Gears:
        I actually went a bit overboard with the gear tooth design.  I started
        out simulating hobbing (CSG subtraction): http://i.imgur.com/Y3MO1.gif

        Then, I got worried that the approximation would not be good enough.
        So, I spent a few months studying the book "Gear Geometry and Applied
        Theory".  I used the ideas in there to create tools that generated the
        tooth surfaces mathematically based on all the parameters I was
        interested in.  Later, I realized that the original approximation would
        work just as well.
    - Escapement:
        Here are animations of my escapement:

          http://i.imgur.com/akejm.gif
          http://i.imgur.com/HtzHM.gif

        Again, I wrote a program that would enable me to specify the pendulum
        angle and it would compute the rest.  My main concern was error
        tolerance.  This is the main problem with building a clock out of
        acrylic instead of metal or wood.  Acrylic cannot be modified once it
        is cut.  Whereas traditional clock makers can achieve amazingly high
        precision by shaving, bending and pinching metal with screws.  They can
        do endless tweaks until it works perfectly.  But, with plastic, it has
        to be cut and assembled perfectly.  Which means that the design must be
        fault tolerant.

        To make that possible, I had the software repeatedly introduce random
        errors in the shape and alignment of the parts.  Until from sampling, I
        had an error range in which everything would still work.  I had it
        optimize until that range grew to 0.1 inches.  Unfortunately, that
        results in large drops in the escapement (it ticks very loudly).  But,
        it guaranteed that the escapement would work when assembled.
    - Laser cutting:
        I also went overboard with the laser cutting digital files.  I had
        trouble using SVG because SVG doesn't contain scale information.  I
        actually ended up creating PDFs.  But, more importantly, I made sure
        that the paths in the file were all continuously connect so that the
        laser did not jump around.  I found that if I did not do that,
        sometimes I ended up with some jagged points that should not have been
        there.  I made sure that the start and stop points were located in the
        valleys between teeth for that reason.  I didn't trust any third party
        software for doing all this.

        My next clock is going to built using low-tech techniques.  I realized
        that there is much easier way to do everything.  I am giving up on
        laser cutting and 3D printing for now.  I over thought everything.
    - Simpler design:
        Involute and cycloidal gears provide 2 advantages: 1) They transfer
        power smoothly and 2) the forces are distributed over multiple teeth.
        But, there are plenty of other gear geometries.  They won't transfer
        power smoothly and consequentially, only 1 tooth is is contact with
        another at any given time.  But, they are easy to construct.  And, they
        can be thrown together from almost anything.  I'll still use software
        to create templates and to verify tolerances, but I am not going for
        laser cutting or 3D printing.  As mentioned in prior response, you can
        tune it a lot more when you built it at that level.  And, I'll be able
        to test it part by part.
    - Power on escapement:
        If you have access to the cutter and the materials, just build
        escapements first.  Recognize that is the heart of the machine.  The
        gears are the easy part.  Get an escapement with no clock attached to
        work.  Figure out how much weight it requires just to power that alone.
        Then, multiply it out to where the barrel will really be located.  For
        instance, if the barrel is powering the minute hand directly, then only
        1/60 of the weight will be powering the escapement wheel.  Even with a
        10 pound weight, that's only 0.167 pounds on the escapement wheel.
        That's a tiny amount of force.  If you can't get an escapement
        mechanism running on that alone, don't bother even trying to build the
        clock.  And, if you have friction in your gear train, you might end up
        with 1/10 of that force.

Notes:
    Y is positive going down. This matches SVG.
    Origin (0,0) is upper-left. This matches SVG.
    In THREE.js, Y is positive going up.
        We negate Y coordinates and angles to match SVG.

    Lessons learned from initial cut on Nov 16, 2014:
        Make separator holes a bit smaller so that the bearings push against them. Otherwise
            the nuts push them in, especially for the axles with multiple separators.
        Slightly more room in the binding holes. Otherwise it's hard to insert the bolts.
        The nuts of the binders run into the other gears, especially if the bolts of the
            binders are too long. Perhaps double the number of separators to avoid this.
        Perhaps remove the blue cover before doing the lasering -- at least for the top side.
        Move the binding nuts further away from the axle so they don't run into the bearings.
    Learned March 15, 2015:
        Did 7,90,5000.
            The recommended value was 9,90,5000, but that stuck in the upper-left.
        Small binding holes are hard to punch out.
            Maybe do two passes. They're probably melting.
            3 times at 14,90,5000 worked.
        Removing acrylic cover first is great.
            No, it burned the acrylic.
        Nut of binding hangs on bearing.
        Add hour and minute hand to gears.
            Okay to cut all the way through if not closed shape.

Questions:
    The gears will start and stop every second. Can we reduce the inertia by
        making them mostly empty? Could we use a cool pattern to do that? Or maybe
        re-use the big empty pieces?

Misc:
    Skateboard inner rod is 8 mm, outer is 22 mm, width is 7 mm (0.28 inches).
        Note that 5/16" ("standard axle") is just short of 8 mm (7.94 mm).
    Could save acrylic by:
        Printing small wheels inside big wheels.
        Cutting out only parts of the big sheets.
    Clocks seem to decouple the swing of the pendulum from the movement of the verge.
        Why? Maybe the pendulum wants to swing less than the verge needs to move.
        Also maybe if the verge holds the pendulum, that's too much friction on
            the axle from the weight of the pendulum. So hang the pendulum from a
            single point, or by bending a thin piece of metal.
        Apparently the piece that connects one to the other is called a yoke, and it
            can increase the push from the verge onto the pendulum.
    Should round out all right angles to make it more robust.
    Could light it with LEDs on the sides, though the acrylic.

Research:
    Look at this model:
        http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Antikythera_model_front_panel_Mogi_Vicentini_2007.JPG
        It seems to use bolts with long spacers.
        This reduces the number of nuts needed to two per bolts.
        We could get longer spacers and cut them ourselves.
        They also seem to use brass instead of steel.

        Uses threaded rods to keep planes together. With nuts and washers.
        Looks like 1/4" acrylic?
        Instead of solid sheets for frame, use horizontal and vertical slats.
        Axles don't rotate, they're fixed.
            That may make it easier to wind the clock or set the time.
        To get two gears to rotate together, put solid acrylic between them and
            bolt together with six bolts.
            We could do that without metal by cutting a rectangle from the gears
                and a slat from acrylic. Getting to fit tightly might be tricky.
            This would also extend the length of the hole, which would make the
                gears more perpendicular to the axle. Could we then use thinner acrylic?
            No glue, so easy to take apart and fix.
        72 teeth for the big gears, about 18 for small gears.
            That's 4-to-1 ratio.
            For minute hand, that's 3600s period.
            Divided by 4 twice, that's 225s.
            Maybe divide by 5 to get 45s for escapement wheel.
        Escapement and verge have very simple triangular shapes.

        3mm acrylic.
        5mm shaft.
        More traditional verge/escapement.
        Uses a sandwich to hold gears together:
            Ring with bearing in the middle.
            Gear (hold is larger than axle)
            Spacer (hold is larger than axle)
            Gear (hold is larger than axle)
            Ring with bearing in the middle.
